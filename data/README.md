## Context

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

## Content

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:

* Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
* Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Inspiration

* Can you describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?
* What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?
* Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Boston?
